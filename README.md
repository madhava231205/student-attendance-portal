# student-attendance-portal
It is a simple attendance portal useful for clubs and volunteer activities where we can enter details of students and make their status on it </br>
It is developed with basic HTML, CSS And Javascript </br>
In this i was able to make lists for different classes and get summary of total students </br>
The Problems I faced to Resolve: </br>
1) while we shift the classes from one to another classes the details which we enter previously get clear and blank list appeared when we visited that class again</br> The data i entered once in the input values  are still present if we open the form again. so it make a issue of time taking to  clear that data and need to enter new data </br>
3) I tried to get the no of students present and absent separately using Aarray method where i can store the status in the array and later count the frequency of one status, but  still after mutliple items i failed again. </br>
Summary : </br>
   after going through lot of tutorials from youtube and with mutliple of doubts in brain i finally done it .
   this experience brings more interest towards web development in myself and want to explore indeep.
